## How to check the course availability with BeautifulSoup

This is a simple Course Availability Checker tutorial for UIUC courses.

This is a project inspired by INFO490 Advanced Data Science and mained implemented with BeautifulSoup, which we learnt in [Week 8 Lesson 3: Introduction to Social Media: Web](https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc/info490-sp17/blob/master/Week8/lesson3.md). The source code is in this [repo](https://github.com/qwang70/Course-Availability-Checker).

User will need to input the subject and course number he/she wants to check availbaility, with year, semester, crn as an option. The script will request pages from courses.illinis.edu every 1000 seconds (about 16 minutes) until it finds user's desired courses. If the user is a Mac user, when a course is found, a notificatin from Mac will show up, and a log file with found available session will be open.


## Pre-requisite 
First, clone or download [the source code](https://github.com/qwang70/Course-Availability-Checker).

You might need to install `python3` and `pip3`.

You might need to download the following python3 libraries:
```
pip3 install numpy pandas lxml beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage
We recommend the user to run the script in the background, with "&" at the end of the commend.
```
python3 course-availability.py -h

usage: course-availability.py [-h] [-y YEAR] [-s SEMESTER]
                              [-crn [CRN [CRN ...]]] [-o OUTPUT]
                              c [c ...]

Find and notify if a desired course has spots.

positional arguments:
  c                     queried subject. Input in the format "SubjectCode
                        CourseNumber"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -y YEAR, --year YEAR  queried year
  -s SEMESTER, --semester SEMESTER
                        queried semester
  -crn [CRN [CRN ...]]  queried CRN
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Specify the directory for the output file location.
                        Default value is the current directory.
```
